# @dashcommerce/starter

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#12](https://github.com/emdashCommerce/dashcommerce/pull/12) [`321e810`](https://github.com/emdashCommerce/dashcommerce/commit/321e810383dc784f9e8f0512dba55a309eae3336) Thanks [@cavewebs](https://github.com/cavewebs)! - Upgrade to emdash 0.6.0.

  - `@dashcommerce/core`: widen `emdash` peer range to `>=0.5.0 <0.7.0`. Bump the bundled devDeps (`emdash`, `@emdash-cms/admin`) to `^0.6.0` so the package builds against current types. No public API changes.
  - `@dashcommerce/starter`: bump `emdash` and `@emdash-cms/cloudflare` to `^0.6.0`. 0.6's [release fix for `syncSearchState` FTS-during-field-creation](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/595) eliminates the partial-DDL issue that was truncating collection schemas on Cloudflare D1 setup and throwing mid-seed on Postgres. Storefront surfaced zero typecheck errors on the upgrade — no porting required.

  Stripe webhook body-clone patch regenerated for 0.6 (`patches/emdash@0.6.0.patch`) since the upstream `request.clone().json()` fix still isn't in place.
